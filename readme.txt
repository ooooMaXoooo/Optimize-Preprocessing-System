				--- Optimize Preprocessing System ---

	Optimize Preprocessing System (OPS) is a program which transform a compiled program into
a new version that is write by our algorithm. 

	The idea behind is simple, we look up at your code in assembly then we modify some piece 
of the code to reduce the complexity of your code. But the preprocessing is longer since we modify
more than a compiler does.

	Before start studying the assembly files, we start modify directly the c++ file but it's less cross-language.
	
To watch update and feature you should work on if you help on this project is only on master branch, on other branch it's not sure that the content is updated.
